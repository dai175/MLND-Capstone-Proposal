## Proposal

### Domain Background

Many owners will want to know the exact breed of their dog. Using machine learning, it is possible to identify the breed of your dog with a single photo of your dog.

This is the assignment that I chose for my Capstone project for "[Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)". ([CNN Project Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification))

### Problem Statement

Machine learning is used to identify dog breeds from images of dogs.

### Datasets and Inputs

Datasets and Inputs are provided in the [Notebook](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/project-dog-classification/dog_app.ipynb) by Udacity.

### Solution Statement

To solve the problem, we use a type of machine learning, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is useful for image recognition.

### Benchmark Model

Pre-trained VGG-16 Model

### Evaluation Metrics

The percentage of correct answers in the test data.

### Project Design

The workflow is shown in the [Notebook](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/project-dog-classification/dog_app.ipynb) by Udacity.

* Step 0: Import Datasets
* Step 1: Detect Humans
* Step 2: Detect Dogs
* Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* Step 5: Write your Algorithm
* Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
